# Fork of Aram Kocharyan's Crayon Syntax Highlighter

This is a (non-Github) fork of Aram Kocharyan's
[Crayon Syntax Highlighter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/)
WordPress plugin. It takes as its starting point a copy of the download of
version 2.8.4, which is preserved in branch `v2.8.4`.

The purpose of this repository is to document changes that I make to the plugin
files.
